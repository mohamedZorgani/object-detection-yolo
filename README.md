# YOLOv5 Object Detection on Car Dataset

## Overview

This project demonstrates the complete pipeline for training and evaluating a YOLOv5 object detection model on a car dataset. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains images and bounding box annotations for car detection. The goal is to train a YOLOv5 model to accurately identify cars within images.

##Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Car Object Detection Dataset](). It includes:

**Images**: High-quality images of cars.

**Bounding Boxes**: Annotations specifying the location of cars in the images.
